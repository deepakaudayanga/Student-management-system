The Student Management System is a desktop application developed in C# that provides an interface for managing student information. This system allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records. It includes essential student data such as name, roll number, date of birth, gender, address, course, and marks.

Key features of the system:

Add Student: Users can input new student details and save them into the system.

Update Student: Existing student records can be edited and updated with new information.

Delete Student: A student's record can be removed from the system.

View Students: A list of all student records is displayed, allowing for easy browsing and search.

Search Functionality: Users can search for students based on specific parameters like name or roll number.



The system is designed using Windows Forms (WinForms) to provide a simple and user-friendly graphical interface. Data storage is handled by a Access database, ensuring persistence and scalability. This system is ideal for educational institutions to keep track of student details and performance.
